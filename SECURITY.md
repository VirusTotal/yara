Reporting security issues
=========================

The YARA authors try their best to keep this software free of security issues,
but 100% secure software does not exist. We appreciate all kinds of bug reports,
but those that constitute a security vulnerability are specially welcomed and
they will be prioritized and publicly acknowledged.

 Please do not open a GitHub issue to report a security vulnerability. If you
 believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit your report to

 ```
 vmalvarez@virustotal.com
 ```

We'll get back to you as soon as possible (usually in 1-2 days).
