YARA for Python
===============

This is a Python extension that gives you access to YARA's powerful features from 
your own Python scripts. 


HOW TO BUILD
============


yara-python depends on libyara, a library that implements YARA's core functions. You
must build and install YARA in your system before building yara-python. The latest
YARA version can be downloaded from:

http://yara.googlecode.com/files/yara-1.3.tar.gz


After installing YARA you can build yara-python this way:

$ tar xzvf yara-python-1.3.tar.gz
$ cd yara-python-1.3
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install

You can test your installation by invoking Python and importing the YARA module:

$ python
Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 17 2008, 19:35:17) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import yara
>>>

In some operating systems (e.g: Ubuntu) you can get an error message like this one:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
ImportError: libyara.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


If you get the previous error you should add the path /usr/local/lib to the loader
configuration file:

$ sudo su
$ echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
$ ldconfig


HOW TO USE
==========

YARA can be also invoked from your own Python scripts. The yara-python extension is 
provided in order to make YARA functionality available to Python users. Once yara-python
is built and installed on your system you can use it as shown below:

import yara

Then you will need to compile your YARA rules before applying them to your data, the
rules can be compiled from a file path:

rules = yara.compile(filepath='/foo/bar/myrules')

The default argument is filepath, so you don't need to explicitly specify its name:

rules = yara.compile('/foo/bar/myrules')

You can also compile your rules from a file object:

fh = open('/foo/bar/myrules')
rules = yara.compile(file=fh)
fh.close()

Or you can compile them directly from a Python string:

rules = yara.compile(source='rule dummy { condition: true }')

If you want to compile a group of files or strings at the same time you can do it by
using the filepaths or sources named arguments:

rules = yara.compile(filepaths={

	'namespace1':'/my/path/rules1',
	'namespace2':'/my/path/rules2'
})

rules = yara.compile(sources={

	'namespace1':'rule dummy { condition: true }',
	'namespace2':'rule dummy { condition: false }'
})

Notice that both filepaths and sources must be dictionaries with keys of string type.
The dictionary keys are used as a namespace identifier, allowing to differentiate between
rules with the same name in different sources, as occurs in the second example with the
“dummy” name.

The compile method also have an optional boolean parameter named includes which allows
you to control whether or not the include directive should be accepted in the source files,
for example:

rules = yara.compile('/foo/bar/myrules', includes=False)

If the source file contains include directives the previous line would raise an exception.

In all cases compile returns an instance of the class Rules, which in turn has a match method:

matches = rules.match('/foo/bar/myfile')

But you can also apply he rules to a Python string:

f = fopen('/foo/bar/myfile', 'rb')

matches = rules.match(data=f.read())

The match method returns a list of instances of the class Match. The instances of this
class can be treated as text strings containing the name of the matching rule. For example
you can print them:

foreach m in matches:
	print "%s" % m

In some circumstances you may need to explicitly convert the instance of Match to string,
for example when comparing it with another string:

if str(matches[0]) == 'SomeRuleName':
	...

The Match class have the following attributes:

rule
namespace
meta
tags
strings

The rule and namespace attributes are the names of the matching rule and its namespace
respectively. 

The meta attribute is a dictionary containing the metadata associated to the rule, where
the metadata identifiers are the dictionary keys.

The tags attribute is a list of strings containing the tags associated to the rule, and
the strings attribute is a dictionary whose values are those strings within the data that
made the YARA rule match, and the keys are the offsets where those strings were found.
