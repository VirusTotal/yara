YARA for Python
===============

This is a Python extension that gives you access to YARA's powerful features from 
your own Python scripts. 


HOW TO BUILD
============


yara-python depends on libyara, a library that implements YARA's core functions. You
must build and install YARA in your system before building yara-python. The latest
YARA version can be downloaded from:

http://yara.googlecode.com/files/yara-1.0.tar.gz


After installing YARA you can build yara-python this way:

$ tar xzvf yara-python-1.0.0.tar.gz
$ cd yara-python-1.0.0
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install

You can also test your installation by invoking Python and importing the YARA module:

$ python
Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 17 2008, 19:35:17) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import yara
>>>


In some operating systems (e.g: Ubuntu) you can get an error message like this one:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
ImportError: libyara.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


If you get the previous error you should add the path /usr/local/lib to the loader
configuration file:

$ sudo echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
$ ldconfig


HOW TO USE
==========

The first thing you need to do is importing the yara module:

import yara

Then you will need to compile the YARA rules before applying them to your data:

rules = yara.compile('/foo/bar/myrules')

The method "compile" of this module returns an instance of the class "Rules", which
in turn has two methods: "matchfile" and "match". The first one applies the rules
to a file given its path:

matches = rules.matchfile('/foo/bar/myfile')

The second one applies the rules to a string:

f = fopen('/foo/bar/myfile', 'rb')
data = f.read()
f.close()

matches = rules.match(data)

Both methods return a list of instances of the class "Match". The instances of this
class can be treated as text string containing the name of the matching YARA rule. 
For example you can print them:

foreach m in matches:
	print "%s" % m

In some circumstances you may need to explicitly convert the instance of "Match" to
string, for example when comparing it with another string:

if str(matches[0]) == 'SomeRuleName':
	...

The "Match" class have another two attributes: "tags" and "strings". The "tags" 
attribute is a list of strings containing the tags associated to the rule. The
"strings" attribute is a dictionary whose values are those strings within the data
that made the YARA rule match, and the keys are the offsets those strings were found.
