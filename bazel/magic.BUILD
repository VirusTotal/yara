# Bazel (http://bazel.io/) BUILD file for the libmagic library.

# Rule for creating magic.h from magic.h.in. The two files are identical, except
# for magic.h.in not having the actual version number. Instead it has a X.YY
# placeholder that is replaced with the version number (i.e: 538) during build
# time. When this library is updated the version number in this rule must be
# updated accordingly.
