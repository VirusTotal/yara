tiny.exe was compiled from a simple oneliner,

    int main() { return 42; }

    $ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -s -Wl,--file-alignment=4096 -o tiny.exe tiny.c

To demonstrate issue #429, two patched executables have been generated
where the PointerToRawData for the .idata section (offset 0x22c) was
changed from 0x5000 to 0x51ff (tiny-idata-51ff.exe) and 0x5200
(tiny-idata-5200.exe), respectively. While tiny-idata-51ff.exe can be
executed in Windows XP, tiny-idata-5200.exe can not.



Compiler version used to produce tiny.exe:

$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc --version
