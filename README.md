## YARA in a nutshell

YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to
identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of
malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary
patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a
boolean expression which determine its logic. Let's see an example:

```
rule silent_banker : banker
{
    meta:
        description = "This is just an example"
        thread_level = 3
        in_the_wild = true

    strings:
        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}
        $b = {8D 4D B0 2B C1 83 C0 27 99 6A 4E 59 F7 F9}
        $c = "UVODFRYSIHLNWPEJXQZAKCBGMT"

    condition:
        $a or $b or $c
}
```

The above rule is telling YARA that any file containing one of the three strings
must be reported as *silent_banker*. This is just a simple example, more
complex and powerful rules can be created by using wild-cards, case-insensitive
strings, regular expressions, special operators and many other features that
you'll find explained in [YARA's documentation](https://googledrive.com/host/0BznOMqZ9f3VUek8yN3VvSGdhRFU/YARA-Manual.pdf).

YARA is multi-platform, running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and can be used
through its command-line interface or from your own Python scripts with the
yara-python extension.

Python users can also use [yara-ctyles](https://github.com/mjdorma/yara-ctypes)
by Michael Dorman. He has also written a multi-threaded command-line YARA
scanner based on yara-ctypes that can exploit the benefits of current multi-core
CPUs when scanning big file collections.

If you are a Ruby user you can use [yara-ruby](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/yara-ruby),
written by Eric Monti.


## What's new in YARA 2.0

YARA has experiencied an almost complete rewrite for version 2.0, as a result
this new version has the following advantages over previous ones:

* It's faster, [believe me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApAFU5ROo10), a
LOT faster. With YARA 2.0 scanning speed is from 2X to 100X faster depending
on your rules. The 100X speedup is only experienced with certain corner cases,
but if you have a large and diverse set of rules you'll definitely notice the
improvement.

* Better multi-threading support. Previous versions of YARA were thread-safe up
to a certain level. You could compile rules and scan multiple files
simultaneously, provided that each thread was using its own set of compiled
rules. In YARA 2.0 multiple threads can share the same compiled rules to scan
multiple files at the same time. The new YARA's command-line scanner takes
advance of that and is now multi-threaded, allowing to scan whole directories
blazingly fast.

* Rules can be saved to binary form. In the same way you would compile your
program's source code to create an executable file, with YARA 2.0 you can
compile your rules and save them into a binary file for later use. This way you
can use pre-compiled rules without having to parse them again, or you can share
rules with someone else without revealing the actual source code (but beware
that each time you do that God kills a kitten).

The drawsbacks for this rewrite are:

* You can find some incompatibilities in regular expressions. YARA 2.0 replaced
external libraries like PCRE or RE2 with its own regular expression engine. Most
regular expression features are present in the new implementation, but a few
ones like POSIX character classes and backreferences are missing. If you were
using RE2 instead of PCRE with previous versions of YARA you won't miss
backreferences, because RE2 don't support them neither.

* The C API provided by libyara has changed. If you're a developer using this
API you'll need to make some changes to your application in order to adapt it
to YARA 2.0. But don't worry, it won't be too much work and the benefits worth
the effort. Users of yara-python are not affected, the Python interface remains
the same.
